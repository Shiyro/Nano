# Nano
A discord bot meant for personal use

# Config

You need to have a PostgresSQL database.\n
Starting the bot the first time will raise an error, but you need to do it once in order to create the config file (./data/config/config.toml).\n
Once you have the config file, you need to specifies the token, prefix, and postgresSQL host and login infos.\n
