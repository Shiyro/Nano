# Nano
A discord bot meant for personal use

# You need to have a PostgresSQL database. 

Starting the bot the first time will raise an error, but you need to do it once in order to create the config file (./data/config/config.toml).
Once you have the config file, you need to specifies the token, prefix, and postgresSQL host and login infos.
